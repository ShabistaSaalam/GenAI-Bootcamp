            Clues, Considerations, Next Steps

            - You'll need to conjugate the verbs into the appropriate tense and politeness level

            - "Did you see...?" requires using the past tense and question form

            - "This morning" is a time expression and should be placed early in the sentence

            - ‚ÄúThey were looking‚Äù can be expressed with a progressive action verb, but at this level, you can simply use the basic verb for "to look at"

            - Use the correct particle to mark the object (raven) and location (garden)

            - Think about whether you need to say ‚Äúthey‚Äù explicitly ‚Äî Korean often implies the subject if it's clear from context

            üîÅ Next Step:
             - Try writing your Korean sentence using the words and structure above! I‚Äôll check your attempt and guide you from there.

        Next Steps 
        - Think about how words connect to each other
        - The verb form needs to show it happened before now
        - Make the first sentence a polite question in past tense
        - Put the time expression near the start
