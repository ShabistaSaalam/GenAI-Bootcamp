Here is an example of simple sentence structure

- The teacher is in the classroom. → [Subject] + [Location] + [Existence verb]

    </user:input>
    <score>8</score>
    <score_reasons>
    -Ok:the clues could be a little better
    -Good: Doesn't provide verbose text at the start,and shows vocabulary immediately.
    -Good: shows conceptual sentence structure
    -Good: clues don't give away any of the tense of conjugations
    </score_reasons>
    <assistant:output>

        Sentence Structure:

        Clues:
        1.Use the verb "두다" (duda) in the past tense to indicate the action of leaving something.
        2.Think about how to use the word "밖" (bakk) to indicate the location "out".
